### During my studies at SNHU, I gained hands-on experience through various virtual labs that simulate real-world operating environments. These labs allowed me to develop and test my skills using industry-standard tools and techniques such as Wireshark, Nmap, Snort, Metasploit, Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Splunk, OpenVAS, Hashcat, OSSEC, John the Ripper, Tenable Nessus, and more.
